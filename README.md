# chess_project:
This project wants to explore the world of chess using this data set: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess.

The goal of this study is to figure out which opening moves are most frequently used and also those that most frequently lead to a win. 
Analysis will also be carried out by dividing the matches according to the rank of the two players, to differentiate the possible outcomes also according to players' skills. 
In addition, it will be analyzed how much starting first (having the white pieces) affects the game's victory and whether this effect, during games with more moves, is less impactful.
